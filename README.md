# Sealas - Zero Knowledge Online Accounting Software For Freelancers

Sealas is Open Source. Open Source in all matters technical: the source code is available on Github, and everybody's welcome to support us with pull requests.

... and Open Source in spirit: we write about the whole development of Sealas and the hows and whys behind our technical, design and business decisions.
